 **Summary:**
The paper introduces Diffusion-based Constrained Policy Search (DiffCPS), a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning that integrates diffusion models with constrained policy search. DiffCPS leverages the action distribution of diffusion models to eliminate the policy distribution constraint, transforming the constrained policy search into a convex optimization problem, which is solved using the Lagrange dual method. The method is validated through experiments on the D4RL benchmark, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing methods. Despite its innovative approach, the paper is criticized for its lack of clarity in presentation, particularly in the formulation of the constrained policy search problem and the integration of diffusion models.

**Strengths:**
- The paper introduces a novel approach by integrating diffusion models with constrained policy search, which is a significant advancement in the field of offline reinforcement learning.
- The theoretical analysis is robust, providing insights into the use of diffusion models in constrained policy search, and the methodology is well-explained, making it easy to follow.
- The experiments conducted are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior or competitive performance compared to existing methods.
- The paper addresses a critical issue in offline reinforcement learning by focusing on the limited expressivity problem in weighted regression, which is a significant contribution to the field.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper suffers from poor presentation, with key definitions and equations not clearly explained, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the methodology and its contributions.
- There is a lack of clarity in the formulation of the constrained policy search problem, and the integration of diffusion models into the methodology is not adequately explained, which could confuse readers.
- The paper's experiments are limited to specific tasks, and it would be beneficial to see how the method performs on a broader range of tasks to validate its generalizability.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational cost of the proposed method, which is a significant concern given the potential for high computational demands due to the use of diffusion models.
- There is a lack of comparison with recent diffusion-based methods, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.

**Questions:**
- Can the authors clarify the formulation of the constrained policy search problem and the integration of diffusion models into the methodology to improve the paper's clarity?
- How does the proposed method compare in terms of computational cost and efficiency with other existing methods, especially those that also use diffusion models?
- Could the authors provide more detailed explanations of the equations and definitions used in the paper to enhance its readability and understanding?
- What are the specific advantages of using diffusion models in offline reinforcement learning compared to other methods, and how does the proposed method address the challenges associated with using diffusion models in this context?
- How does the proposed method perform on a broader range of tasks beyond those tested in the current study, and what are the implications of these results for the generalizability of the method?

**Paper Decision:**
- Decision: Reject
- Reasons: The paper, while introducing an innovative approach by integrating diffusion models with constrained policy search, suffers from significant presentation issues that hinder understanding and evaluation of the proposed method. The formulation of the constrained policy search problem and the integration of diffusion models are not clearly explained, making it difficult for readers to grasp the methodology fully.
