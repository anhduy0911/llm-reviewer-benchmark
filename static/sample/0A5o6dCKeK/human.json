        "Metareview": "The paper introduces an any-to-any multimodal LLM, where modality alignment is performed not only in the input as in previous approaches, but also in the output (between the LLM and diffusion decoders of different modalities). The reviewers raised concerns about the over-reliance on pre-trained models and unclear effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors prepared a very extensive response, with many new experiments, including more baselines, performance on additional benchmarks, and qualitative results (We thank the authors for their effort!). The final scores were mixed, with one reviewer recommending acceptance, two borderline rejects, and one borderline accept. As a borderline case, the paper was then discussed by the AC and SAC. They both see merits in the paper, and consider the problem of studying any-to-any multimodal models very important. However, the following remain major concerns: 1) The issue with evaluation goes beyond beating SOTA methods, as there is no standard benchmark for evaluating any-to-any models. In this respect, it is difficult to properly evaluate the proposed approach; 2) We consider legitimate the concern raised by the reviewers that the alignment techniques are a bit naive and most of the work is done by the pre-trained models \u2014 in this sense, the technical contribution is limited; 3) The authors should tone down some claims in the paper about human-level capabilities and reasoning (and anyway they would be inherited by the pre-trained models rather than the proposed method). Finally, the paper would benefit from a second round of reviews given the new experiments provided in the rebuttal. Based on these reasons, the ACs recommend rejection, but encourage the authors to further improve the paper for another top-tier conference or journal submission.",

            "Summary": "This paper proposes a multi-modal LLM, called any-to-any MM-LLM, to extend the multi-modality of LLM to a state where there is no limitation on the input and output modality combinations. To achieve this goal, the authors (1) propose a lightweight alignment learning technique to achieve en effective semantic alignment across different modalities with limited trainable parameters and (2) annotate a modality-switching instruction tuning dataset. The displayed results and visualizations suggest the promising performance of the tuned any- to-any MM-LLM.",
            "Strengths": "* Extending the multi-modal LLMs free of limitation on the input/output modalities is an important research question that can facilitate a wider range of applications.    * The introduced dataset, if made publically available, would be a good contribution to the community.   * Various evaluation benchmarks are used to benchmark the proposed model with existing solutions.    * The writing is clean and easy to follow",
            "Weaknesses": "* The proposed alignment learning technique is a bit naive and does not consider much about the challenge introduced by the any-to-any modality, such as how to balance the performance across different modalities.    * Although introducing contents from different modalities during tuning is considered to improve the overall performance of the model, in the experiment section, it seems introducing these additional modalities actually leads to worse performance on benchmarking datasets. Does this indicate the alignment technique is not effective enough as expected?",

            "Summary": "This paper introduces NExT-GPT, an end-to-end, multi-purpose, multi-modal Language Learning Model (MM-LLM) capable of generating text, images, audio, and video. The system is designed to be efficient, utilizing a small quantity of parameters. Furthermore, a multimodal instruction dataset named MosIT is presented, which facilitates cross-modal understanding and content generation.",
            "Strengths": "1. The system architecture is compact and includes multiple decoders for text, video, audio, and image generation, making it straightforward to implement.   2. The generation process is end-to-end and does not require initial text generation.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. The quality of the generation output is primarily dependent on the pre-trained generation modules. If these modules are flawed or produce errors, the system cannot rectify these issues. For instance, if in image generation, stable diffusion struggles with accurately rendering certain elements (e.g., the number of human fingers), NExT-GPT would not be able to produce an accurate output, irrespective of its understanding of the instruction.   2. The evaluation strategy appears questionable. It seems that the NExT-GPT model used in the evaluation was fine-tuned on individual datasets, which may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of the proposed method.   3. What would be the results if the model was trained on a mixture of the proposed MosIT dataset and benchmark datasets, and then evaluated on the benchmarks? Additionally, in a multimodal language model, text generation is crucial. It would be interesting to know how the system performs on recent benchmarks such as MME [1], MMBench [2], and SEEDBench [3].   4. The qualitative comparison provided lacks thoroughness. The paper only presents a few demonstrations and fails to provide comparisons with other MLLMs, including InstructBLIP [4], LLaVA [5], mPLUG-Owl [6] for text generation, and DreamLLM [7] and EMU [8] for conditioned image generation.",

            "Summary": "This paper proposes a unified framework that enables any-to-any generation. Specifically, it receives inputs from multiple modalities, such as text, audio and video. Furthermore, it leverages off-the-shelf LLMs and diffusion models, which enables efficient training. They propose to leverage special tokens that encodes the semantics, and then feed this to the diffusion model to act as the conditional input. The paper shows promising results on the evaluated benchmarks.",
            "Strengths": "This paper proposes a novel approach to enable any-to-any generation by integrating off-the-shelf diffusion models with LLMs. The proposed approach to align the semantic tokens with outputs from text encoders of diffusion models seems efficient. The results look promising.",
            "Weaknesses": "The major concern I have regarding this paper is the training object during alignment, which is to align the semantic tokens with outputs from text encoders of diffusion models. This seems reasonable at first, but if the objective is to \"match the semantics token with textual captions' representations from the text encoders of diffusion models\", why not just directly use the diffusion model's text encoder to encode the textual captions? More specifically, why not just let the LLM output a caption according to some fixed format, and extract the caption, then feed it to the diffusion model for generation? I think it would be a more direct approach and probably will enable better performance. Unfortunately, I do not find comparison with this simple alternative in the paper.",
