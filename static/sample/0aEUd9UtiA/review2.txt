**Summary:**
DiffCPS presents a novel offline RL algorithm that leverages diffusion models to address multimodal policy challenges. The approach reformulates policy search as a constrained optimization problem, using a strong duality framework for efficient gradient-based optimization. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks show competitive performance, highlighting diffusion models' potential in offline policy optimization. While introducing significant novelty, the method's computational complexity and reliance on theoretical conditions are noted.

**Strengths:**
- Innovative use of diffusion models for capturing complex, multimodal policies in offline RL.
- Strong theoretical foundation via a strong duality framework enabling efficient gradient-based optimization.
- Empirical validation demonstrating competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

**Weaknesses:**
- Higher computational costs compared to simpler policy representations.
- Theoretical results depend on Slater’s condition, which may not always hold.
- Specifically tailored to diffusion models, limiting generalization to other policy representations.

**Questions:**
- How can the computational complexity of diffusion models be mitigated for larger-scale offline RL tasks?
- What are the practical implications of the reliance on Slater’s condition for the duality framework?
- Could the approach be extended to other policy representations, such as flow models, and what modifications would be required?
