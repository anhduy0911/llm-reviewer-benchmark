 **Summary:**
The paper introduces NExT-GPT, a novel multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that integrates a text-based LLM with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders to handle text, image, video, and audio inputs and outputs. The model is designed to be flexible, allowing for any-to-any modality generation, and is supported by a modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) method. The authors also introduce a new dataset, MosIT, for instruction tuning, which includes 5,000 dialogues with complex cross-modal understanding and content generation. The paper evaluates the model's performance across various benchmarks and tasks, showing competitive results against existing models. However, concerns are raised about the novelty of the approach, the lack of significant technical innovation, and the potential for unfair comparisons due to the use of powerful decoders like stable diffusion models.

**Strengths:**
- The paper presents a well-designed, end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any multimodal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) named NExT-GPT, which integrates a text-based LLM with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders, enabling the handling of inputs and outputs in various modalities.
- The authors introduce a modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) method and construct a high-quality dataset for MosIT, which is beneficial for MM-LLM with human-like cross-modal content understanding and instruction reasoning.
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides comprehensive details on the design, implementation, and evaluation of NExT-GPT.
- The proposed method demonstrates good performance on various benchmarks and tasks, showing the effectiveness of the model in handling multimodal inputs and outputs.
- The paper introduces a new dataset, MosIT, which includes 5,000 dialogues with complex cross-modal understanding and content generation, which is a valuable resource for the research community.

**Weaknesses:**
- The technical contribution of the paper is limited, as the proposed method primarily involves aligning different inputting multimodal features with the text feature space and using signal tokens to instruct the decoding layers, which are common in multimodal LLMs.
- The novelty of the proposed method is questionable, as it appears to be a combination of existing models and techniques without significant innovation.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with other multimodal LLMs, especially in terms of performance and efficiency, which is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model.
- The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that NExT-GPT is capable of modeling universal modalities and paving the way for more human-like AI research.
- There is a lack of analysis on the limitations and failure cases of NExT-GPT, which is essential for understanding the model's robustness and reliability.
- The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed method, which is crucial for understanding the scope and applicability of the model.

**Questions:**
- How does the proposed method compare with other multimodal LLMs in terms of performance and efficiency?
- Can the authors provide more details on the design and implementation of the MosIT dataset, including its construction process, data sources, and annotation guidelines?
- How does the proposed method handle the potential for unfair comparisons due to the use of powerful decoders like stable diffusion models?
- Can the authors provide more evidence or examples to support the claim that NExT-GPT is capable of modeling universal modalities and paving the way for more human-like AI research?
- How does the proposed method handle the potential for hallucinations in the generated content, especially in multimodal formats?
- Can the authors provide more details on the limitations of the proposed method and discuss how these limitations affect the model's performance and applicability?

**Paper Decision:**
- Decision: Reject
- Reasons: The paper, while introducing a novel multimodal LLM with a flexible architecture and a new dataset, fails to convincingly demonstrate a significant technical contribution over existing models. The primary concerns include the lack of novelty in the approach, the potential for unfair comparisons due to the use of powerful decoders, and the limited technical innovation. The reviewers also noted that the paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential for hallucinations in the generated content. These factors lead to the decision to reject the paper.
